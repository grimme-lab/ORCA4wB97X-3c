# ORCA4wB97X-3c
Fortran script for setting up a wB97X-3c calculation with ORCA.

To set up an input file for wB97X-3c, you have to execute the binary in a directory with a 'coord' file.

See the "-help" flag for further possibilities.

WARNING: Due to the use of a deprecated I/O routine, the use of 'coord' files with scientific notation is not possible.
